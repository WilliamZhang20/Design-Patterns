## SOLID Design Principles

This directory contains my work to practice & learn the SOLID design principles fundamental to Object-Oriented software Design (OOD). 

The principles are:

S: Single Responsibility Principle: a class should have only one reason to change....i.e. one responsibility. The easiest of the principles.

Example: In the file `single-responsiblity.cpp`. I implement a program which calculates areas for various shapes, and formats the output. Each shape has only one purpose - to contain & extract its data. That's easy for shapes. A square has only its width. A circle has only a radius. Similarly, the single function of calculating area for any shape is dedicated to one class. 

O: Open-Closed Principle: 

L: Liskov Subsitution Principle

I: Interface Segregation Principle

D: Dependency Inversion Principle
